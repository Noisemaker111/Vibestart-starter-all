Below is a minimal template for project-structure.mdc that contains nothing except the live directory map.  
The assistant’s only responsibility is to keep this map 100 % accurate; no history, no reasons, no follow-up tasks.

```markdown
<!-- project-structure.mdc — single source of truth for layout     -->
<!-- The assistant must rewrite the tree below whenever files or   -->
<!-- folders are added, removed, or renamed.                       -->

Agent rule set (not stored in the file, but always enforced):

- Rewrite the entire tree whenever the directory layout changes.  
- Preserve the comment header and main heading exactly as shown.  
- Use POSIX paths and two-space indentation under each level.  
- Include one brief, inline description per folder or file when helpful.
