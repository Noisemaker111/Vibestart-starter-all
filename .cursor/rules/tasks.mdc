# Tasks Hub

This rule file tracks **active** and **upcoming** tasks for the VibeStart project and provides ready-to-use prompts for AI agents.

---
## How to use this file
1. **Add a task** under *Current Tasks* or *Future Tasks* by copying the relevant template.
2. Fill in every placeholder â€• do **not** delete field labels. If a field is not yet known, write `TBD`.
3. When a *Future Task* begins, move it to *Current Tasks*.
4. When a task is closed, remove it (historical record lives in Git history).

---
## Field Reference
â€¢ **slug** â€“ kebab-case identifier, stable for the lifetime of the task.<br/>
â€¢ **summary** â€“ one-sentence description.
â€¢ **prompt** â€“ full prompt given to the AI agent when it starts the task.<br/>
â€¢ **context** â€“ anything the agent should know before coding: related files, user stories, blockers, links, etc.
â€¢ **acceptanceCriteria** â€“ bullet list of objective checks required for completion.
â€¢ **roles** â€“ map of role â†’ responsibilities (PM, Front-End, Back-End, UI, UX, DevOps, QA, etc.).
â€¢ **steps** â€“ dependency-ordered checklist; each step begins with the responsible role in **bold**.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** keep tasks small (â‰¤ 1 person-day). Split larger items into multiple tasks.

## Custom Future Task

```md
slug: prefill-build-idea-from-home
summary: Navigate to Build Idea page with user selections preloaded

description: |
  When a user selects desired integrations and a platform on the Home page and clicks "Get Building", they should be redirected to the Build Idea page/tab. The destination page must have its header (or equivalent top section) pre-populated with the integrations and platform that were chosen, ensuring continuity of context for the user.

preliminarySteps:
  1. Review current selection state handling in `src/client/pages/home.tsx` and supporting components.
  2. Choose and implement a state transfer method (e.g., React Router navigation state, URL query parameters, or shared context) to carry the selected integrations and platform.
  3. Update the "Get Building" button to navigate to the Build Idea route with the selections embedded.
  4. On the Build Idea page, render the received selections at the top of the interface.
