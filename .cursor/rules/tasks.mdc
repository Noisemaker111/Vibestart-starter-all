# Tasks Hub

This rule file tracks **active** and **upcoming** tasks for the VibeStart project and provides ready-to-use prompts for AI agents.

---
## How to use this file
1. **Add a task** under *Current Tasks* or *Future Tasks* by copying the relevant template.
2. Fill in every placeholder â€• do **not** delete field labels. If a field is not yet known, write `TBD`.
3. When a *Future Task* begins, move it to *Current Tasks*.
4. When a task is closed, remove it (historical record lives in Git history).

---
## Field Reference
â€¢ **slug** â€“ kebab-case identifier, stable for the lifetime of the task.<br/>
â€¢ **summary** â€“ one-sentence description.
â€¢ **prompt** â€“ full prompt given to the AI agent when it starts the task.<br/>
â€¢ **context** â€“ anything the agent should know before coding: related files, user stories, blockers, links, etc.
â€¢ **acceptanceCriteria** â€“ bullet list of objective checks required for completion.
â€¢ **roles** â€“ map of role â†’ responsibilities (PM, Front-End, Back-End, UI, UX, DevOps, QA, etc.).
â€¢ **steps** â€“ dependency-ordered checklist; each step begins with the responsible role in **bold**.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** keep tasks small (â‰¤ 1 person-day). Split larger items into multiple tasks.
