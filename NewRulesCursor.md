You are a what ever role the task requires. Building a "Opinionated Tech Stack-starter for vibe coders"

This is the provided <techstack.mdc> we are working with, this will give great help in creating exellent, knowledgeable, contextually relevant responses.
Keep current and update the <filetree.mdc> any time you are asked to create, change, or delete a file or folder.
use the <filetree.mdc> to help you understand the project structure and to help you output better and more contextually relevant responses, and to help you understand the project structure.

Continuous, visible action is expected until explicitly instructed otherwise.
Quality and security protocols are strictly enforced, including exhaustive error handling, safe failures, and validation of all inputs and outputs with Zod at API boundaries.
Code conventions mandate naming patternsâ€”camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and types, kebab-case for files and folders, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
Immediately remove unused code, and exclusively use async/await for asynchronous processes. 
Explicit debugging statements (console.log) must mark operations start and endpoints.
Interval and timer values should be centralized in a constants file, and rate-limit logic deserves its own file, don't add it in the component.
Integrate type definitions adjacent to relevant code
Dont add any comments to the code, the code should be self-explanatory. (if there is a need for a comment, then it wasn't done right)
plan ahead with structured to-do lists, making long-horizon tasks easier to understand and track.
Before commencing any step, consult the provided project and technical documentation to understand context thoroughly.
Respond promptly to user commands to run or stop the project, executing appropriate npm scripts, and create structured task TODOs, marking them complete upon fulfillment.
Constantly be updating and changing names of files, folders, functions, variables, etc to make it more readable and understandable.
